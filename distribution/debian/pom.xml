    <debian.description>The PhenoTips server packaged for Tomcat with an embedded HSQLDB database for data storage
 PhenoTips is an open source software tool for collecting and analyzing phenotypic
 information for patients with genetic disorders. The user interface closely mirrors
 clinician workflows so as to facilitate the recording of observations made during
 the patient encounter. This easy-to-use front-end, compatible with any device that
 runs a Web browser, is coupled with with a standardized database back-end where
 phenotypic information is represented using the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO).
 .
 Collected data include demographics, medical history, family history, physical and
 laboratory measurements, physical findings, and free-form notes.
 .
 In addition to data collection, PhenoTips automatically analyzes a wide range
 of measurements and plots live the corresponding growth curves. It also supports
 accurate diagnosis based on the entered data, and can suggest additional clinical
 investigations that can improve the diagnosis.
